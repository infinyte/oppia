          - This is Mercury, a small metallic planet closest to the sun. Since it
            is so near to the sun, it only takes 88 days for it to travel one entire
            orbit, so a year on Mercury would only be 88 days long.

          - This is Venus, the second planet from the sun. It is the brightest planet
            in the Solar System, and can sometimes even be seen during the day. Though
            Mercury is nearer to the sun than Venus, Venus is the hottest planet in
            the Solar System, because its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide traps
            heat on its surface.

          - Earth! Our home planet is the third planet from the sun. Despite the vastness
            of the Solar System and the rest of space, it is the only place that we
            know life exists on. It is at just the right distance from the sun to
            ensure a comfortable temperature for us to exist in.

          - Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is often dubbed the "red planet"
            due to its color, which is a result of large quantities of iron oxide
            on its surface. It has a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide and ice caps
            on either end, and has two small irregularly-shaped moons called Phobos
            and Deimos.

          - Jupiter, the fifth planet from the sun, is a huge planet that is 2.5 times
            heavier than all of the other planets in our Solar System combined. It
            is mostly formed out of thick gases around a solid core. One famous feature
            on it is the "Great Red Spot", which is a huge storm on its surface that
            has raged for at least 350 years, and is large enough to swallow three
            entire Earths.

          - Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun. It was the first planet that
            was discovered using a telescope, since it is normally too dim to be seen
            with the naked eye. It is the coldest planet, and is formed from layers
            of hydrogen gas enveloping a frigid core of rock and ice.

            Uranus, with an outer layer of hydrogen, helium, and methane enveloping
            an icy core. The methane in its atmosphere absorbs red light, giving it
            a beautiful blue color. It was first predicted to exist from gravitational
            calculations, and was only discovered by telescope later.

            reclassified as a "dwarf planet". It is formed from ice and rock, and
            is even smaller than our moon. The first spacecraft to visit Pluto is
            due to reach in July 2015.
